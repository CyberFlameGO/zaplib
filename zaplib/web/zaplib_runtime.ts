  // return new data.constructor(buffer, 0, bufferLen);

//   // That solves for the mutable buffer case. In the read-only buffer case, you do the above to create a mutable buffer, and then send it back to Rust via to move the data into an Arc<Vec<â€¦>> via __zaplibMakeBufferReadOnly, then return that, and now you have your read-only buffer.
