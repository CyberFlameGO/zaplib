The standard WebAssembly interface is incredibly low-level. It doesn't include many functions that would typically be included in a standard library. The Zaplib Standard Library includes:

* Logging
* Threading
* HTTP requests 
* WebSockets
* Reading files
* Generating random numbers
* Browser focus
* Profiling
* Timers
